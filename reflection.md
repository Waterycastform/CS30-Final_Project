1. what advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?

    I would say spend a little more time at home getting down the basics of a new library/extension like p5.play. It would give me a lot more time to actually start building the project rather than just spending class time trying to understand the game engine. I would also spend more time collecting images I would like to use for the game so I have time to actually use some textures rather than just colours.

2. did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?

    Yes :)

3. What was the hardest part of the project?

    The hardest part was trying to figure out stuff like friction and mass . There was no tutorial on the p5.play website which explained how exactly these parameters worked with the sprites so I spent a lot of extra time trying to figure them out. Some of the math for the mass didnt seem to work out so I abandoned using the mass function. I tried to compensate for this using a higher friction amount but this had the effect for making the characters get stuck on the walls if they are in the air. Apart from that, blending p5.play and regular p5.js was a bit of a challenge, especially when trying to figure out how the different canvases overlay each other.

4. Were there any problems you could not solve?

    The only current issue with the game is the problem with the characters getting stuck on the walls if they jump and press against them at the same time. However, I feel this is only minor and serves as just an inconvenience for the game play, not rendering it unplayable. I would have liked to add some texture to the maps but due to time I wasn't able to figure out how to fit the images into the correct sprite shapes.

5. What are you most proud of?

    Even thought they are relativley simple, I am quite proud of how both of my levels look. I think all the different elements game together nicely at the end to make a decent game. I think the groups and subgroups for the kill blocks are nicely organized and the boxes and portals were easy to move around from level to level using states.
