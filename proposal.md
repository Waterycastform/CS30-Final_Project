# Proposal

I would like to create a Fire Boy & Water Girl clone game. This is a stage based, platformer-esque game in whcih players must get to the end of a stage within a time frame while avoiding obstacles. I will probably use the p5.play library as well as possibly p5.collide2D. The game will have a few levels, will be 2-player, and will have gravity.

## Need To Have List:
- 2 Player functionality v
- 2 - 3 Stages
- Working gravity for characters v
- Start/End pages v
- Level Select page v
- Water/Lava obstacles v
- Box objects to move around v
- Game Instructions screen v
- Timer for levels v
- Sound effects and Backround music v

## Nice To Have List:
- Levers and Buttons to open doors
- Nice transions between levels
- Character Animations
- Collectable Gems
- Level Scoring system
- More levels with increasing difficulty
