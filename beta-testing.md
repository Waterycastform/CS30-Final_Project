Beta Tester 2: Aidan
-Conducted Jan. 23rd

    -Noted some friction issues when jumping and pressing against wall
        Attemped to fix this but ran into trouble with how friction works, no tutoiral on friction on the p5.play website so had to try and wing it
    -Was able to get through the game easily due to familiarity with what the game is
    -Some of the friction issues made the levels a bit tedious but doable nontheless
